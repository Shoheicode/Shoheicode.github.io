This is the instructions, requirements, and starter for stage two of the Snap Engineering Academy application process.

## For my task Task:

<h3 align="center">Created an El Camino Catalog Website </h1>

## Requirements - 

 - Utilzed data structures including binary trees and arrays
 - Created objects to hold data 
 - Display a substantial amount of interesting data from the El Camino Courses Catalog! Found online for datasets or make your own. 
 - Data is located in the courses.js file 
 - Two features to manipulate the data set includes filtering and searching
 - Additional features include removing and adding data set to arrays to store favorite courses
 - Look polished. Use HTML and CSS to customize how you display your data. Display your data thoughtfully, as it’s much more useful that way!

The home page is where you begin and you are greeted by a welcoming aura and sign.

You will see the navigation bar above which will help you navigate through the website. If you scroll down you will see 2 additional sections which will lead you to the pages for the 
courses catalog and the programs at El Camino. 

#Catalog Page:

Here is our catalog page, where you will find in the javascript file courses.js the information for our catalog. We have over 20 different courses and honestly it can be expanded to much more without much issue. These courses are some of the needed courses for students to transfer through the IGETC program for community colleges.

There are also sorting and searching features available to find specific courses you need for your IGETC.

Through this page, I hoped to help students be able to navigate through college and be able to have access to this type of information easily.

We have a pop up menus for every one of the courses which helps provide additional information for each of the courses. It helps explains what the course typically entails and what can be expected.

Finally, if you like a specific course, make sure to heart the course and it will be added to your favorites section of the catalog page where you can hold onto that important course.
