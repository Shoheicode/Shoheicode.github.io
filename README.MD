This is the instructions, requirements, and starter for stage two of the Snap Engineering Academy application process.

<h3 align="center">Created an El Camino Catalog Website </h1>

## Requirements - 

 - Utilzed data structures including binary trees and arrays
 - Created objects to hold data 
 - Display a substantial amount of interesting data from the El Camino Courses Catalog! Found online for datasets or make your own. 
 - Data is located in the courses.js file 
 - Two features to manipulate the data set includes filtering and searching
 - Additional features include removing and adding data set to arrays to store favorite courses
 - Look polished. Use HTML and CSS to customize how you display your data. Display your data thoughtfully, as it’s much more useful that way!  
 - Be an original website. Please do not submit something you’ve already done for a school project, internship, or client.
